# MusicArtists
This is task test application for passing the selection of the 
[Yandex mobile school development 2016](https://academy.yandex.ru/events/mobdev/msk-2016/).

The main purpose of the app is loading [JSON data](http://download.cdn.yandex.net/mobilization-2016/artists.json), 
parsing that data and then displaying parsed data for the user in a handy way.
In that project used a powerful image downloading and caching third party library [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/).
